Master's Thesis documents

The main branch stores the R files:
- script: the original pipeline in which we develop each step of the analysis
- BrdUwrapper: the script included inside a new an only big function
- app: the application settings. This file has been previously created, in this work we just add the BrdUwrapper to the original application.

The second branch is the results one. We include the plots from the quality assessment of the raw reads, the log files from the alignments, as well as the coverage bed files, the ratio files, peaks files, and pdfs with the results.
