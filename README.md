# Velasco_Marta_MT
Master's Thesis documents. In this repository is possible to find the files derived from the pipeline included in the Velasco_Marta_MT repository

We can find in the main branch the results files also. We include the plots from the quality assessment of the raw reads, the log files from the alignments, as well as the coverage bed files, the ratio files, peaks files, and pdfs with the results.

The original raw reads are not included due to their size, as well as the alignment bam files. If necessary, ask for them at martavd@uoc.edu
