Master's Thesis documents

The main branch stores the R files:
- script: the original pipeline in which we develop each step of the analysis
- BrdUwrapper: the script included inside a new and only big function
- app: the application settings. This file has been previously created, in this work we just add the BrdUwrapper to the original application

We can find in the main branch the results files also. We include the plots from the quality assessment of the raw reads, the log files from the alignments, as well as the coverage bed files, the ratio files, peaks files, and pdfs with the results.

The original raw reads are not included due to their size, as well as the alignment bam files. If necessary, ask for them at martavd@uoc.edu
